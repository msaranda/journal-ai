- Chat supervisor saves each chat and gives a feedback based on the guidelines I provide in a markdown file
- AI Critic makes requirements stricter when the AI Coach learns. The AI Coach is aware of the assessment and knows the feedback, so it knows what needs to improve.

- A lot of small AI-led analysis in order to fill the gaps in my bio. The Biographer looks for missing information and other smaller AI agents provide specialised analysis

- There's a tool that looks for ambiguity and asks the user with YES or NO questions, or WHICH ONE questions, etc. It makes the notes about the user more concise so it enhances the user experience.

- Each entry should have a mood check so AI can correlate mood with specific kinds of messages.
